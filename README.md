# CS 262 Design Exercise 1: Wire Protocols

## Description

These are implementations of a chat application that we designed for CS262 using a wire protocol and GRPC.

## Built on

We built a server and client using the `socket` and `threading` native Python libraries for our wire protocol implementation. For our GRPC implementation, we used the `grpcio` and `grpcio-tools` libraries.

## Setup and Installation

Install the dependencies in `requirements_<OS>.txt` using conda by creating a new conda environment and running `conda install --file requirements_<OS>.txt` for your respective OS. If this fails, in a new conda envrionment run:

```
conda install grpcio grpcio-tools pyyaml
```

If this fails, run:
```
pip3 install grpcio grpcio-tools pyyaml
```

## How to run the app

1. Modify the `config.yaml` file to change the host so that it matches in the server and client. To get `host`, you'll need the the IP address of the machine of the server (run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` for Mac or `ipconfig getifaddr eth0` for Linux or run `ipconfig` and look for the IPv4 address for Windows).

2. Navigate into the `chat` folder and run `python3 server.py` on the server first, and then on the other machine navigate into the `chat` folder and run `python3 client.py` on the client. 

3. After the client has connected to the server, type in a command in the client terminal, following the commands below.

### Commands for the client

All messages sent by the client be an op code followed by the pipe "|" character.

```
Format: <command>|<text>
0|<regex>           -> list user accounts
1|<username>        -> create an account with name username
2|<username>        -> login to an account with name username
3|                  -> logout from current account
4|                  -> delete current account
5|<username>|<text> -> send message to username
6|                  -> deliver all unsent messages to current user
```

### Disconnecting the client

To shut down the client and disconnect from the server, type `quit` in the client terminal. 

## How to run the tests

Navigate into the `chat` folder and run `python3 tests.py`. Tests should all pass with a `All tests passed!` message in the console.
